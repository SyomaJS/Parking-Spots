1. First of all you have to create new postgreSQL database. Called    "parking"

2. Install necessary libraries with                                   "npm install"

3. Connect to your own database server. In order to do this you have to change the  ".env"  file.

    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/parking?schema=public"



4. Migrate the prisma with "npx prisma migrate dev" 

5. And finally run the code "npm run start:dev"
